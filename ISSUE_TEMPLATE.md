## Issues

**FIRST: Test if the mod has the same error in Vanilla Forge**. If it does, then Thermos is *not at fault* and we cannot help you here.

If a mod does not work with Thermos *specifically*, please check [here](https://github.com/TCPR/Fixes) before posting an issue.

**We will NOT provide support for Reikas mods under ANY circumstances.**
